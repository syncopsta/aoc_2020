# Advent of Code - 2020 - Python

## Day 1 - Expense Report - Code [Python3](day1.py) - [Input](input_day1)
* Part 1: Find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?
* Part 2: In your expense report, what is the product of the three entries that sum to 2020?

## Day 2 - Password Philosophy - Code [Python3](day2.py) - [Input](input_day2)
* Part 1: How many passwords are valid according to their policies?
  * Each line gives the password policy and then the password.
  * The password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid.
  * For example, 1-3 a means that the password must contain a at least 1 time and at most 3 times.

* Part 2: How many passwords are valid according to the new interpretation of the policies?
  * Each policy actually describes two positions in the password, where 1 means the first character, 2 means the second character, and so on.
  * (Be careful; Toboggan Corporate Policies have no concept of "index zero"!)
  * Exactly one of these positions must contain the given letter.
  * Other occurrences of the letter are irrelevant for the purposes of policy enforcement.

## Day 3 - Toboggan Trajectory - Code [Python3](day3.py) - [Input](input_day3)
* Part 1: How many trees you hit, on a grid with a specific stepping pattern?
* Part 2: Multiply the number of trees you hit with different stepping patterns.
